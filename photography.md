From time to time i mutate into a hobby-photographer and try to capture the world from my camera's point-of-view. Some shots i find beautiful are depicted here. Some are enhanced using Affinity Photo on iPad Pro.

	Be aware: some panorama files can easily exceed 100 MB - wait for them to load, and make sure you are not on a mobile connection or these pictures will eat away your bandwith. You have been warned.
