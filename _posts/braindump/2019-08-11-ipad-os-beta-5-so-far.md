While the preceeding Public Beta releases seemed rather unstable i have so far not experienced any issues with Public Beta 5. I even went and upgraded my personal iPad Pro to it since it's quite good. All apps shown in the above screenshot work at least superficially like they should. I haven't had any issues with e.g. Working Copy which was struggling to do a proper `git push` using PB4.

It's not a production release, so better stay on the safe side if your feer data loss or an unstable systems.

And make those backups. 

iPadOS is starting to come together nicely. I'm really looking forward to the public release.
