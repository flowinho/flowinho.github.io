_This image is not manipulated in any way other than obscuring the license plates of the cars. Don't even start asking me about the weird bike tracking actually crossing the street._

Cars. Cars everywhere. Every now and then, green spots. 

Bycicle tracks? Sometimes. If you're lucky, those tracks do _not_ end abruptly. If you're really lucky, those tracks have markings on **both** sides.

But in Ludwigsburg? You get to choose wether to ride on the street, or on the street, since cars parking absolutely everywhere. Do not forget: riding by bike is your own fault.

Why not just take the car? Like _everyone else_?
