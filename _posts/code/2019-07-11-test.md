This blog post was written on July 10th, 2019, but scheduled for July 11th, 2019. If the Travis CI Integration of my blog following [this tutorial](https://shot511.github.io/2018-12-03-how-to-schedule-posts-with-jekyll/) works it should appear on July 11th, since TravisCI should trigger a rebuild of the blog.

Let's hope this works!
